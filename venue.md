Many of our workshops have taken place at Microsoft NERD. Here are some
instructions specific to this venue:

1. Request a space using their [form] *at least* 6 months in advance.
1. Review usage guidelines and the list of preferred caterers. (They will send
you a copy or some links to these documents.)
1. Share any special instructions with the Catering coordinator if applicable.
1. Provide a list of names of everyone who might be there.
  * It must be submitted 3 days in advance so they can distribute it to the
security desk.
  * Include all attendees, coordinators, TAs, guests, and waitlist names.
  * Include the name of the event, dates, and room in the body of the email. For
example.:

      > RailsBridge Boston event on 10/4/2013 from 7pm-10pm and 10/5/2013
      > from 9:30am-5pm in the Mann/Sampson/Paul room

  * Send the list as a file attachment to nerdconf@microsoft.com, CC'ing whoever
our NERD Center contact is and the lead coordinators.
1. Make sure that we tell everyone to bring a photo ID, per NERD Center policy.
