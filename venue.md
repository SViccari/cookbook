# Venue

## Workshop

Responsibilities:
* Book a venue at least 4-6 months in advance
* Coordinate with venue contact over any logistics when using the space, e.g.
what's off-limits, equipment use, catering, security, etc.

Venue criteria:
* Preferably free
* Holds at least 100 people
* As easily accessible as possible, e.g. by the T

For the past few workshops, we've been able to book some space at the [Microsoft
NERD Center].  We have the space reserved for May 2014 and August 2014 workshops.

In case of hosting the event at NERD:
* Work with the location coordinator (nerdconf@microsoft.com).
* See usage guidelines and the list of [preferred caterers].
* Provide a list of names of everyone who might be there. It must be submitted 3
days in advance so they can distribute it to the security desk. Get the TA and
teaching staff from the teaching coordinator, and attendees and waitlist from
registration.
  * The NERD Center is most interested in having a complete list with good
  * lead time, so
there's no issue with waitlist being potential attendees.
  * Include all attendees, organizers, TAs, guests, and waitlist names.
  * Include the name of the event, dates and room in the body of the email and
text file. Something like this:

      > RailsBridge Boston event on 10/4/2013 from 7pm-10pm and 10/5/2013
      > from 9:30am-5pm in the Mann/Sampson/Paul room

  * Send it as a text file attachment to nerdeal@microsoft.com, CC'ing Leah (or
our NERD center contact) and the Railsbridge organizers.
  * The list will provide a final headcount for catering.
* Everyone must bring a photo ID, per NERD center policy.

## After-Party

Find and book a bar/restaurant for our after-party a week in advance if
possible.  Bars we've used:
* Meadhall - next to the Marriott - they have an upstairs room that a lot of
Meetups use
* Firebrands and Saints - Kendall Square
* Cambridge Brewing Company ( a bit far from the NERD center - better in warm
weather )

Venue criteria:
* Easily accessible via walking
* Holds at least 30-40 people
