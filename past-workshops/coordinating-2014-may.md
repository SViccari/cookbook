## Plus/Minus/Delta for next time
* Simplify meal options to vegetarian, vegan, no restrictions, and 'other'.  Participants historically note dairy- and gluten-free needs in other, and we'll take that into account when we order.
* We got afternoon coffee from the catering service instead of picking it up at Dunkin Donuts. Win.
* Catering final numbers go in on Weds; there were a number of cancellations and no-shows by Friday, both TA and attendee.  Order a % less.  There were a LOT of extra lunches.  We shared leftovers with NERD center staff and other conference-goers, so it all got eaten.
* Lunches were huge and delicious, and there were leftovers. We returned most of what we got for afternoon snacks - yay Trader Joes return policy! Buy less next time. PM coffee and tea are still needed.
* TA signups on EventBrite worked ok.  Need to communicate clearly that signups are going through EventBrite.
* We had small participant turnout since it was part 2. We had our usual generous level of TA volunteers, so had to cut down the numbers.  Asking for un-volunteers brought the number down - there's always a lot to do in May - and we cut a few more to get a 1:3 ratio.  We had some no-shows, but the workshop was small enough that it still worked out.
* Put a collection box for reusing nametag holders at the door Saturday afternoon
* Proofread between tutorial and the installfest material - make sure directories match


## TA Hall of Fame

3. Cori Allen is a Kansas transplant in Boston. After graduating from Babson College, she liked helping debug her employersâ€™ websites with developers in India, Indonesia, and Slovenia better than everything else at work. When she built her first "Hello world" HTML page, she was hooked. Three weeks later, she enrolled in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive programming bootcamp, fell in love with Ruby on Rails, and hasn't looked back.
