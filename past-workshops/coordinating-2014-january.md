## Coordination Log for Workshop

**Final attendance stats:**

      |Registered|Attended
:-----|---------:|--------:
Women |       77 | 72
Men   |       11 | 10
Other |        1 |  0
**Total** |  **89** | **82**

Turnover:  19 orders ( 20 seats total) cancelled beforehand, some self-cancelled and some by email. 1 wait list ticket offered, but unclaimed.

Notes: For previous workshops we offered ~90 tickets and turned cancellations over to the wait list.  This time we built the margin into the tickets offered. Cancellations are usually in the last 2 days, by which time the wait-listers have made other plans for the weekend.   There may have been less churn due to the time of year. In summer there are more competing weekend events, and more likelihood that a better option will come along.

**Menu planning**

+ No dietary restrictions: 60
+ Vegetarian: 24
+ Vegan: 1
+ Dairy-Free: 2
+ Halal: 2

( We aren't including nut allergies as a restriction - we order nut-free everything)
For next time: ask TAs about their dietary restrictions

**OS Support Planning**

OS | Total| Versions
:--|-----:|:--------
OSX|51|10.6, 10.7,10.8, 10.9
Windows| 27 | 7 Home, 7 Professional 8, 8.1, XP, Vista
Linux/Other|7|13.1, LTS, Nadia(14), jessie, unsure, Chromebook
Not sure|4|


## Plus/Minus/Delta for next time

* ask TAs for food preferences
* only one major change at a time - installfest changes OR curriculum changes
* don't schedule workshops in January - too close to the holidays, everyone is bus
* the breakout sessions were cool and well received
* Q&A sessions were also very cool, and kept things energetic
* for Ruby-only workshops let Mac users use built-in ruby instead of VM
* different windows versions bring up different problems.  Work machines that are locked into a domain had extra problems.
* with self-guided material, people can start on Friday if they're moved to
* with self-guided material, people didn't have a sense whether they were keeping up with the pack. They also felt torn between cool breakouts and finishing the material
* one-room schoolhouse: build in more challenges and mini projects that can be enhanced and iterated on
* swapping afternoon coffee and snacks for breakfast was good - everyone was lagging by 2PM
* Proofread between tutorial and the installfest material - make sure directories match
* put a collection box for reusing nametag holders at the door Saturday afternoon
