## Create an Eventbrite event

1. This can be done well in advance; EventBrite keeps drafts private until you
   make them live.

1. Check the [private repo][credentials] for the RailsBridge Eventbrite account
   login information.

1. [Copy the event page][copying instructions] from the last workshop.

1. Update the relevant information for the new workshop: *dates*, *location*,
   *number of tickets* available.

1. Update the Order Confirmation page with the same info.

1. Re-evaluate the number of tickets available.

    The fire code limits us to 120 people (participants and TAs both) at the NERD
    center.  We aim for 1 TA per 4 participants, so that's about 96 participants and
    24 TAs and organizers.  For workshop 7 (January) we started with 110 tickets, which was about
    perfect - 89 participants after cancellations, 82 showed up.  For workshops 5
    and 6 we kept 90 available, churned through the waitlist, and had about 50
    attendees.  We've been raising the initial number of tickets.

    Eventbrite will automatically trigger the waitlist when all tickets are sold,
    but will NOT offer tickets to people on the wait list if tickets become
    available through cancellation.

1. Make sure the childcare question is re-enabled or re-added.

  It should be a radio button question that says, "Thanks to thoughtbot, we're
  offering free on-site childcare. Do you need childcare to attend the workshop?"

1. Update the event URL to be more human-friendly.

  On the Event Dashboard, there should be an option to edit the event URL.
  Usually, we follow the format of: `railsbridgeboston[month and year of
  event].eventbrite.com`.

1. Provide the Sponsorship Coordinator with the special link for TAs sent by
sponsors. It'll look something like:
https://railsbridgeboston012017.eventbrite.com?discount=special_invite.

### Ticket types

There should be 3 ticket types:
  * Participant
  * TA
    - This should end 2 weeks before the workshop so that the TA Coordinator can
    get back to them about whether or not they are accept. This will also give
    people time to prepare for their presentations and look at the curriculum.
  * Invited TA
    - This one is reserved for TAs that are sent by sponsors.
    - This can stay open until the very last-minute, but preferably, we should
    know about them at least 1-2 weeks ahead of time.

Ticket "sales" should end ~1 week before the workshop.
