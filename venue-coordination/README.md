# Venue Coordination

The Venue Coordinator books a venue for the workshop as well as the after-party.

## Workshop Venue Guidelines
Timeframes:
Friday 6:00-9:30pm
Saturday 9:00am-5:30pm

These timeframes include 30-minute prep/setup at the beginning
of each day and then a little bit of time to clean up at the end. If we could
arrive earlier to accommodate catering arrivals, that would be great.

Criteria:
* Free, preferably
* Can hold up to 100 people
* As accessible as possible (e.g. easy access to the T, parking available)
* Has a separate space for child care

###Questions to ask: 
Daycare:
* Dedicated area for baby sister + babies
* Is there a motherâ€™s room that can be locked from the inside?

Presentation:
* Are there microphones? Are they rechargeable? Does the venue supply you with replaceable batteries?
* Is there a microphone stand? Wireless?
* How do you lower the projector?

Wifi:
* Password?

Space
* How do you dim the lights?
* Is there a room where you can store the supplies for the night?
* Is there another person from the company that will be helping us?
* Will there be construction during the time of the venue?
* Is the conference room locked?
* Are there power strips (~4)? Are there sufficient outlets in the floor/along the walls?
* Is it wheelchair accessible?
* Is it easily accessible by public transit?

Security:
* Is there a security guard downstairs? Who do we give the guest list to?
* Do we have access to the building over the weekend? Is the building door locked?

Bathroom:
* Is there a unisex bathroom?

Trash
* If the trash overflows what can we do?

Catering

## After-Party Venue Guidelines

Criteria:

* Within walking distance
* Holds at least 20-30 people, sitting and/or standing

Calling the venue about a week ahead of time should be fine.

See [this doc](./previous-after-party-venues.md) for where we've gone before.
