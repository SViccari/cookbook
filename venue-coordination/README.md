# Venue Coordination

The Venue Coordinator books a venue for the workshop as well as the after-party.

## Workshop Venue Guidelines

Criteria:
* Free, preferably
* Can hold up to 100 people
* As accessible as possible (e.g. easy access to the T, parking available)
* Has a separate space for child care

The timeframes we need are: **Friday 6:00-9:30pm** and **Saturday
9:00am-5:30pm**. These timeframes include 30-minute prep/setup at the beginning
of each day and then a little bit of time to clean up at the end. If we could
arrive earlier to accommodate catering arrivals, that would be great.

When talking to someone about the venue, be sure to ask about any logistics when
using the space, e.g. what's off-limits, equipment use, catering (do they have
preferred vendors, where should they come in, etc.), security, etc.

Check out where we've held workshops previously
[here](./previous-workshop-venues.md).

## After-Party Venue Guidelines

Criteria:

* Within walking distance
* Holds at least 20-30 people, sitting and/or standing

Calling the venue about a week ahead of time should be fine.

See [this doc](./previous-after-party-venues.md) for where we've gone before.
