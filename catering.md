# Catering

Catering is the biggest budget item for RailsBridge and a major part of the
event. We typically do the following, based on 80-90 people at the workshop:

* Friday night: pizza and drinks - ~$500
  * Take out the tip from the RailsBridge Boston account with the ATM card
  * Be at the NERD center when the delivery arrives before Friday night.
* Saturday daytime: coffee, lunch, snacks - ~$2000 ( TODO: update this amount )
  * AM and PM coffee: Kendall Square Dunkin Donuts - 4 Boxes o' Joe - TODO:
look at getting coffee through NERD catering or Whole Foods catering -- it's a
lot of work.
  * Afternoon cookies and snacks: pick up from Trader Joes or a supermarket
beforehand.  Get a mix of cookies, trail mix, apples, and juice.
  * Can use different caterers for different meals.
* Saturday night: after-party drinks and appetizers - ~$700
  * Based on 30-40 of the 80-90 attending.
  * Depending on attendance, only offer the first round of drinks. Feel free to
add another round and/or some appetizers as budget allows.

Here's what to do:
* Place catering orders about 1.5 weeks ahead of the workshop.
* Ask caterer when they want to be paid, e.g. on delivery, after the event, etc.
* Make sure we cover those who have dietary restrictions. Dietary restrictions
are a question on the registration form.
  * Ask the caterer about peanut-allergy-safe foods, gluten-free, etc.
* Work with Admission and TA coordinators to get head counts and dietary
restrictions.
* Add a few more "servings" for some wiggle room.
* Be sure we're leaving the space in a good state.
  * **Be green** Ask the venue's contact person about disposing trash -- how
they would like us to handle that.

## Payment
The Catering Coordinator should be placing the orders first. The vendors will
tell her when payment is due for the food. Usually, they will take credit card
payments over the phone or cash at their business location.

Work with Melissa for payment.

For the after-party, payment is made right there to the bartender during the
after-party. There may be a room reservation fee or minimum drink and appetizer
purchase amount depending on the venue. Use the RailsBridge Boston Bridge
Foundry debit card.
