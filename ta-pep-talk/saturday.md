# TA Pep Talk (Saturday)

Get the TAs all together and emphasize the following points:

* Go over [Friday] points again
* Please pick a table, sit down in the center, and announce your name and that
  you are here to help. Emphasize that you've given up your Saturday and
  literally don't have anything to do besides answering questions. When people
  ask questions, get really excited (but don't force it too much) and answer
  them. All of this will help people ask questions.
* Sometimes people just don't ask questions. Check in with people every so
  often; a quick "Can I help anyone? Are you suuuure?" can go a long way.
* Encourage TAs to give out their contact information if they want to.
