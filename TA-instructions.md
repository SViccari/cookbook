This is a guide for our TA's on how to prepare for the workshop.

First off though, thanks for volunteering and making this happen. Over the years
of running these workshops, we've consistently gotten feedback on how amazing
the TA's were. We're very excited to have you be a part of this experience.

Your main guide is of course the website:
    http://www.railsbridgeboston.org/

To start off, there is a nice rundown of logistics and schedule you should be familiar with:

For machine set-up on Friday, please review the installfest guide so you'll be prepared to help our students:
    http://www.railsbridgeboston.org/installfest

More importantly, if you haven't already, please work through the Saturday curriculum:
    http://www.railsbridgeboston.org/curriculum/curriculum_toc

Many of you have been through this before, but even so, I know I'll be at least reading through again.
I recommend you at least once actually go through the steps and build out the app.

You may also want to get some helpful advice and information about being a TA.
Railsbridge has a page of resources and tips for workshop teachers:
http://workshops.railsbridge.org/resources-for-teachers/

...and a deck you can go through with some more ideas on creating a welcoming
classroom environment, teaching beginners, etc.
http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/workshop/teacher_training

These workshops are always fun and inspiring. You're going to be a huge help to
these students who are just getting started with Ruby or Rails.

We encourage you to help each other out, get to know the other TA's and
volunteers, and just enjoy yourself.

Looking forward to seeing you all on Friday!
