I'm sending this out to all the Railsbridge Boston Workshop TAs to help you get ready for our second workshop this Friday & Saturday.

First off though, thanks for volunteering and making this happen.

Your main guide is of course the website:
    http://www.railsbridgeboston.org/

To start off, there is a nice rundown of logistics and schedule you should be familiar with:

For machine set-up on Friday, please review the installfest guide so you'll be prepared to help our students:
    http://www.railsbridgeboston.org/installfest

More importantly, if you haven't already, please work through the Saturday curriculum:
    http://www.railsbridgeboston.org/curriculum/curriculum_toc

Many of you have been through this before, but even so, I know I'll be at least reading through again.
I recommend you at least once actually go through the steps and build out the app.

You may also want to get some helpful advice and information about being a TA. Railsbridge has a page of resources and tips for workshop teachers:
    http://workshops.railsbridge.org/resources-for-teachers/

...and a deck you can go through with some more ideas on creating a welcoming classroom environment, teaching beginners, etc.
    http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/workshop/teacher_training

Last time we did this, it was great fun, effective, and at times inspiring.
What a big help this can be to those just getting started.
Looking forward to seeing you all on Friday!
