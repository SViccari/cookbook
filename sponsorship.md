# Sponsors

Since August 2012, RailsBridge Boston has been running free workshops to
introduce women to programming in Ruby and web development with Ruby on Rails.
The long term goal was to increase the number of women in the Ruby community and
the software development industry.

This is made possible through a number of great volunteers and sponsors. We have
held numerous workshops so far at the Microsoft NERD Center, Harvard Law School,
MIT Stata Center, and the Intelligent.ly office, with very positive feedback
from participants.

Each workshop needs about 5-10 sponsors, each of whom would contribute towards
food and drinks for the entire workshop and the post-workshop celebration.

For more information on sponsorship and the current options, please take a look
at the [prospectus].

# Financial Logistics
As of December 2013, we've moved to using [Bridge Foundry] to handle our
financials, as well as that of other RailsBridge chapters.

Bridge Foundry is a nonprofit group, started by the RailsBridge San Francisco
community, that promotes outreach programs in technology and assists with the
financial infrastructure.

As a volunteer organization, we found the process for creating a 501(c)3 to be
too long (two years on average). We wanted to make donations tax deductible for
our sponsors, as well as ensure our financial processes remain smooth as we
grow the group of volunteers organizing workshops.

Sponsor donations are made to Bridge Foundry, and Bridge Foundry makes the funds
available to us through a debit card. This is simpler than our old process,
which was to have sponsors pay vendors directly.
