# Sponsors

Since August 2012, RailsBridge Boston has been running free workshops to
introduce women to programming in Ruby and web development with Ruby on Rails.
The long term goal was to increase the number of women in the Ruby community and
the software development industry.

This is made possible through a number of great volunteers and sponsors. We have
held numerous workshops so far at the Microsoft NERD Center, Harvard Law School,
MIT Stata Center, and the Intelligent.ly office, with very positive feedback
from participants.

Each workshop needs about 5-10 sponsors, each of whom would contribute towards
food and drinks for the entire workshop and the post-workshop celebration.

For more information on sponsorship and the current options, please take a look
at the [prospectus].

# Financial Logistics
RailsBridge Boston is working with [Bridge Foundry](https://atrium.schoolfactory.org/bridgefoundry/dashboard). Bridge Foundry was
started by the RailsBridge San Francisco community in order to provide infrastructure for outreach programs in technology.

As a volunteer organization, we found the process for creating a 501(c)3 to be too long (two years on average).  We want to make donations tax deductible for our sponsors,  as well as ensure our financial processes remain smooth as we grow the group of volunteers organizing workshops.

Sponsor donations are made to Bridge Foundry, and Bridge Foundry makes the funds available to us through a debit card. This is simpler than our old process, which was to have sponsors pay vendors directly.
