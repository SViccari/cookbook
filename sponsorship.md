# Sponsors!

RailsBridge Boston has been holding free workshops, starting in August 2012, in order to introduce more women to web development with Ruby on Rails, with a long term goal of increasing the number of women in the Ruby community and the software development industry.

This is made possible through a number of great volunteers and sponsors- we have held numerous workshops so far at the Microsoft NERD Center, Harvard Law School, MIT Stata Center, and the Intelligent.ly office, with very positive feedback from participants.

Each workshop needs about 10 sponsors, each of whom would donate about $400.00 in order to provide food for Friday night and all Saturday.

Each sponsor can participate by calling in a payment information to one of the specified vendors a few days before the workshop. Unfortunately, this is not tax-deductible, but we are working on solving this for future workshops.

As a sponsor, your company logos will be displayed on our website when you are invited to attend our Friday night session, as well as attend the after-party on Saturday . You'll be able to introduce yourself to new talents, and remind the 20+ experienced TAs of your organization's commitment to a more diverse workforce!

Thank you for your past and on-going sponsorship.

# Financial Logistics
RailsBridge Boston is working with [Bridge Foundry](https://atrium.schoolfactory.org/bridgefoundry/dashboard). Bridge Foundry was
started by the RailsBridge San Francisco community in order to provide infrastructure for outreach programs in technology.

As a volunteer organization, we found the process for creating a 501(c)3 to be too long (two years on average).  We want to make donations tax deductible for our sponsors,  as well as ensure our financial processes remain smooth as we grow the group of volunteers organizing workshops.

Sponsor donations are made to Bridge Foundry, and Bridge Foundry makes the funds available to us through a debit card. This is simpler than our old process, which was to have sponsors pay vendors directly.
