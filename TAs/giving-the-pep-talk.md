# TA Pep Talk

## Friday

Get the TAs all together and emphasize the following points:

* Never, ever take the keyboard away from people. It's hard, but guide them
  through doing things themselves.
* Windows is generally harder to set up than other OSes. Please don't make jokes
  about how "windows sucks" - it's hard enough to be here without that, and
  people will hear it.
* Be careful using jargon as it might be intimidating.
* Emphasize that it's really hard to break a computer by typing something wrong
  into the terminal.

## Saturday

Get the TAs all together and emphasize the following points:

* Go over [Friday] points again
* Please pick a table, sit down in the center, and announce your name and that
  you are here to help. Emphasize that you've given up your Saturday and
  literally don't have anything to do besides answering questions. When people
  ask questions, get really excited (but don't force it too much) and answer
  them. All of this will help people ask questions.
* Sometimes people just don't ask questions. Check in with people every so
  often; a quick "Can I help anyone? Are you suuuure?" can go a long way.
* Remind participants that there are no "stupid questions".
* Encourage participants to post their question(s) in the Slack channel or Google
  doc as well as the answer if/when they have it. That way they can help others
  who might be wondering the same thing.
* It can be easy to cluster with the other TAs when it looks like participants
  don't need help. While talking to other TAs is fine, it can be intimidating
  for a participcant to inturrupt conversations.
* It's ok for TAs not to know the answer to every question. TAs should not feel
  bad asking other TAs for help. It actually sets a good example.
* If there are error messages, explain what they mean and how they
  point to where the problem might be.
* Encourage TAs to give out their contact information if they want to.
