# TA Pep Talk

## Friday

Get the TAs all together and emphasize the following points:

* Never, ever take the keyboard away from people. It's hard, but guide them
  through doing things themselves.
* Windows is generally harder to set up than other OSes. Please don't make jokes
  about how "windows sucks" - it's hard enough to be here without that, and
  people will hear it.
* Support other TAs when they present. Presenting is hard and scary and they can use your support.
* Try not use words like "simple", "easy", or "just". The attendees are _brand new_ and it isn't easy! Encourage their questions and make them feel like they're doing it right by running into problems
* The thumb drives are not for students to keep. We need those all back!

## Saturday

Get the TAs all together and emphasize the following points:

* Go over [Friday] points again
* Please pick a table, sit down in the center, and announce your name and that
  you are here to help. Emphasize that you've given up your Saturday and
  literally don't have anything to do besides answering questions. When people
  ask questions, get really excited (but don't force it too much) and answer
  them. All of this will help people ask questions.
* Sometimes people just don't ask questions. Check in with people every so
  often; a quick "Can I help anyone? Are you suuuure?" can go a long way.
* Encourage TAs to give out their contact information if they want to.
