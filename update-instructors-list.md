We keep the instructor list on workshop coordination pages like [this one]. This
lets us give a little permanent recognition to volunteers, and is there when a
returning TA says "you already have my bio".

[this one]: ./past-workshops/coordinating-2014-september.md#ta-hall-of-fame

Get the current TA list from Eventbrite and add it to the file for the upcoming
workshop. To get list from Eventbrite:

1. Go to https://www.eventbrite.com/myevents/.
1. Click "Manage" for the appropriate event.
1. Click "Event Reports" from the sidebar.
1. Select "Sales By Ticket Type" under "Report Type".
1. Select "Attended" under "Attendee Status". (This means they checked in.)
1. Select "Teaching Assistant Signup" under "Ticket Type".
1. Click the "CSV" button.

Tweak the content if desired - e.g. make them all third person intros.
