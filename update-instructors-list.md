We keep the instructor list on workshop coordination pages like [this one]. This
lets us give a little permanent recognition to volunteers, and is there when a
returning TA says "you already have my bio".

[this one]: ./past-workshops/coordinating-2014-september.md#ta-hall-of-fame

Get the current TA list from the Google spreadsheet/form that collects TA
volunteer info. Add it to the file for the upcoming workshop.

Tweak the content if desired - e.g. make them all third person intros.
