The instructors list is kept in  https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/railsbridge-boston/blob/master/instructors.yml  . It's displayed on the page dynamically, so you have only to update this file.

When starting the next workshop, open the rendered page in a web browser.  Cut and paste it to the wiki organizing page for the last workshop ( [like here](https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/railsbridge-boston/wiki/Coordination-for-Oct-2013-Workshop)).  This lets us give a little permanent recognition to volunteers, and is there when a returning TA says "you already have my bio".

Get the current TA list from the Google spreadsheet/form that collects TA volunteer info.

Tweak the content if desired - e.g. make them all third person intros.

The format for the yml file is...
<pre>
"Firstname Lastname":
    |
    is a very interesting person. Ninja, rockstar, singer, dancer, actor -- and most importantly, Railsbridge volunteer.
</pre>

Note the spaces indenting the pipe and bio lines.

Commit and push when done.
