## Venue & Catering

Please update this page as you go through the steps.  Better documentation will make it easier for the next volunteer.

### Catering

Catering is the biggest budget item for RailsBridge and a major part of the
event. We typically do the following, based on 80-90 people at the workshop:

* Friday night: pizza and drinks - ~$500
 * Take out the tip from the Railsbridge Boston account with the ATM card
 * Be at the NERD center when the delivery arrives
before Friday night.
* Saturday daytime: coffee, lunch, snacks - ~$2000 ( TODO: update this amount )
 * AM and PM coffee - Kendall Square Dunkin Donuts - 4 Boxes o' Joe - TODO: look at getting coffee through NERD catering or Whole Foods catering, it's a lot of work
 * Afternoon cookies and snacks:  pick up from Trader Joes or a supermarket beforehand .  Get a mix of cookies, trail mix, apples, and juice.
 * Can use different caterers for different meals .
* Saturday night: after-party drinks and appetizers - ~$700
 * Based on 30-40 of the 80-90 attending.
 * Depending on attendance, only offer the first round of drinks. Feel free to
add another round and/or some appetizers as budget allows.

Here's what to do:
* Place catering orders about 1.5 weeks ahead of the workshop.
* Ask caterer when they want to be paid, e.g. on delivery, after the event, etc.
* Make sure we cover those who have dietary restrictions. Dietary restrictions are a question on the registration form.
 * Ask the caterer about peanut-allergy-safe foods, gluten-free, etc.
* Work with Admission and TA coordinators to get head counts and dietary restrictions
* Add a few more "servings" for some wiggle room.
* Be sure we're leaving the space in a good state.
 * **Be green** Ask the venue's contact person about disposing trash -- how they
would like us to handle that.

### After-party venue

Find and book a bar/restaurant for our after-party a week in advance if possible.
Bars we've used:
* Meadhall - next to the Marriott - they have an upstairs room  that a lot of Meetups use
* Firebrands and Saints - Kendall Square
* Cambridge Brewing Company ( a bit far from the NERD center - better in warm weather )

Venue criteria:
* Easily accessible via walking
* Holds at least 30-40 people

### Payment
The Catering Coordinator should be placing the orders first. The vendors will tell her when payment is due for the food. Usually, they will take credit card payments over the phone or cash at their business location.

Work with Melissa for payment.

For the after-party, payment is made right there to the bartender during the afterparty. There may be a room reservation fee or minimum drink and appetizer purchase amount depending on the venue. Use the Railsbridge Boston Bridge Foundry debit card.

### Workshop Venue

Responsibilities:
* Book a venue at least 4-6 months in advance
* Coordinate with venue contact over any logistics when using the space, e.g. what's off-limits, equipment use, catering, security, etc.

Venue criteria:
* Preferably free
* Holds at least 100 people
* As easily accessible as possible, e.g. by the T

For the past few workshops, we've been able to book some space at the [Microsoft
NERD Center](http://microsoftcambridge.com/eventmanager/).  We have the space reserved for May 2014 and August 2014 workshops.

In case of hosting the event at NERD:
* Work with the location coordinator (nerdconf@microsoft.com)
* See usage guidelines and the list of [preferred
caterers](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iii5lhbatpw51lq/Microsoft_NERD_Preferred_Vendors.pdf).
* Provide a list of names of everyone who might be there. It must be submitted 3
days in advance so they can distribute it to the security desk. Get the TA and teaching staff from the teaching coordinator, and attendees and waitlist from registration.
    * The NERD Center is most interested in having a complete list with good lead time, so
there's no issue with waitlist being potential attendees.
    * Include all attendees, organizers, TAs, guests, and waitlist names.
    * Include the name of the event, dates and room in the body of the email and text file. Something like this:
> "RailsBridge Boston event on 10/4/2013 from 7pm-10pm and 10/5/2013 from
> 9:30am-5pm in the Mann/Sampson/Paul room"
    * Send it as a text file attachment to nerdeal@microsoft.com, CC'ing Leah (or
our NERD center contact) and the Railsbridge organizers.
    * The list will provide a final headcount for catering.

* Everyone must bring a photo ID, per NERD center policy.
